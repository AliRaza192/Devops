# Git and Github Concepts and Commands

### 1. Introduction to Git
**Definition**
Git is a distributed version control system designed to help developers track changes in their codebase and collaborate effectively in teams.

**Concepts**
Version Control: Git helps keep track of changes made to files over time, allowing users to revert to previous versions if necessary.

Distributed System: Unlike centralized systems, Git provides each user with a complete clone of the repository, including its entire history.

Snapshots, Not Differences: Git saves the state of files as snapshots. If a file hasn’t changed, Git doesn’t duplicate it but instead links it to the previous snapshot.

Efficient Collaboration: Multiple developers can work on the same project simultaneously without overwriting each other’s work.

**Why Git?**

Tracks the history of changes.

Allows branching and merging for parallel development.

Supports collaboration without a central server.

Offers performance and reliability.

**Common Use Cases**

Version control for software development projects.

Collaboration between team members.

Maintaining a history of changes for audits or debugging.
